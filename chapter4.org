** Vectors
" Although you might not think of your data as vectors, they are a good way to represent numeric data."

If you take Kalid Azad's advice and think of vectors as being the building blocks of a math for spreadsheets, it becomes much easier to think of your data this way.

#+begin_src scala

val heightWeightAge = Vector(70, // inches
                            170, // pounds
                            40) // years

val grades = Vector(95, // exam1
                   80, // exam2
                   75, // exam3
                   62) // exam4

val vectorAdd = (v: Vector[Double], w: Vector[Double]) => {
  v.zip(w).map{x: (Double, Double) => x._1 + x._2}
}

val vectorSubtract = (v: Vector[Double], w: Vector[Double]) => {
  v.zip(w).map{x: (Double, Double) => x._1 - x._2}
}

val vectorSum = (vv: Vector[Vector[Double]]) => {
  vv.reduceLeft(vectorAdd(_, _)) // abstracting away the declaration of intermediate state
}

/** Returns the elements of v multiplied by c
  * v is a vector, c is a scalar
  */
val scalarMultiply = (c: Double, v: Vector[Double]) => {
  v.map(_ * c) // look at that concise expression of a powerful idea
}

/** Returns a vector consisting of the element-wise means of the input vectors
  */
val vectorMean = (vv: Vector[Vector[Double]]) => {
  val n = vv.size
  scalarMultiply(1.0/n, vectorSum(vv))
}

/** Returns the dot product of two vectors
*/
val dotProduct = (v: Vector[Double], w: Vector[Double]) => {
  v.zip(w).map{vw: (Double, Double) => vw._1 * vw._2}.sum
}

Kalid Azad has a great intuition for the dot product:

Rotate one vector to the baseline and then multiply the amount that they overlap along the baseline. Let's test this!

#+begin_src scala

val vectors = (Vector(3.0, 4.0), Vector(3.0, 4.0))
val vectorsRotated = (Vector(5.0, 0.0), Vector(5.0, 0.0))
// I caught a flash of the pythagorean theorem in my head as I typed this

assert(
  dotProduct(vectors._1, vectors._2) == 
  dotProduct(vectorsRotated._1, vectorsRotated._2)
)

#+end_src

The assertion passes, which means that the rotated and unrotated vectors extend the same length in the same direction.

#+begin_src scala

val sumOfSquares = (v: Vector[Double]) => {dotProduct(v,v)}
val magnitude = (v: Vector[Double]) => {Math.sqrt(sumOfSquares(v))}
// and now we're extending the pythagorean theorem into an arbitrary number of dimensions

val squaredDistance = (v: Vector[Double], w: Vector[Double]) => {
  sumOfSquares(vectorSubtract(v,w))
}

val distance = (v: Vector[Double], w: Vector[Double]) => {
  Math.sqrt(squaredDistance)
}
