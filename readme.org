** A polyglot approach to data science
This book contains reproductions of the code samples from Joel Grus' book Data Science from Scratch in Python (the original language), Scala, and Clojure. A multi-language implementation will make the concepts stick better, as well as portray relevant distinctions between the languages if the code is written in an idiomatic way.
